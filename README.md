Video analysis software for sport.
VideoAssistant simplifies cutting of clips form training or competition, especially if you want to trim a long video into many short videos.

## Features
 * Simple design and tagging
 * Adjustable playback speed
 * Up to four nameable tags at the same time
 * Frame accurate cutting
 * Merge all clips of the same tag to one video or render multiple short clips
 
## Requirements
 * 64 bit version of Windows 7/ 8/ 10
 * VLC media player (64 bit)
 * Microsoft Visual Studio redistributable runtime (Download: https://www.microsoft.com/de-DE/download/details.aspx?id=52685)

## Install
1. Download the latest release of the compiled software from https://github.com/Leon-1207/VideoAssistant/releases
2. If you have downloaded the .rar file extract it on your computer.
3. VideoAssistant needs the 64 bit version VLC media player from VideoLAN to work.
4. Make sure that the main folder of the VLC media player (the folder VLC should contain files like vlc.exe) is located at this location:
